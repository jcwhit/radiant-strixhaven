Councilors from each of the founding civilizations govern The Citadel from The Preserve, mandating trade laws and municiple matters so that The University is the most dangerous part of The Citadel. The Council seems to turn a blind eye to The Hall of Whispers, and even tends to employ their services from time to time.

Far below the balconies, the Court of Flowers and the pier ring with the merry laughter and the songs of laborers. Year round, Zinda\u2019s plazas and parlors are full of academics, merchants, and pilgrims. But for ten days in the summer, the March of Vice draws even larger crowds as the city celebrates the local wine trade\u2014specifically, the jeli wine that has made Zinda the wealthiest city in the land. Zindanese citizens garb themselves in brightly colored costumes and feathered headdresses and indulge in feasting, song, and dance. After its recent years of prosperity, a cloud has settled over the city. Political dissidents are rumored to disappear from their beds as the Silent Verse, the enforcers of the ruling Kings of Coin, stalk the streets. The Bloodletters laborers\u2019 union opposes the leadership of the aristocracy at every turn.</p>"}]}
